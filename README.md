Currently this is nothing more than a clone of https://gitlab.com/ronie/skin.transparency Here Ronie acknowledge it was ok to fork and continue on work https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=360613&pid=3019610#pid3019610


My hope is to learn how to do a skin for Kodi and get this updated and included back in the main repo.  I think this repo will mainly be used for learning and for the art as it might be better to start from scratch on a brand new code base.


Thank you again Ronie for all the years of working on this skin.
